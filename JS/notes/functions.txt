In JS , functions are called as first class citizens.

functions are understand by 3 things 
 function declaration
 function definition
 function call

 The main uses of functions are reusability, split the code.

 function function-name(parametrs)-->declaration
 {
    //code --> body/def
 }
 function-name(arguments) -->calling

 function incre(a)
 {
    console.log(++a)
 }
 incre(5)

Every function also be stored as a variable by default with same name
console.log(incre)--> it will print whole function

you can also give name like function expression

var xyz= function incre()
{
    console.log("something")
}
console.log(xyz)--> will print whole function.
 you can even remove name and call the function as anonymous function

 callback functions:
 writing or taking one function as aparameter to another function is called call back function

the function which is taking is called Higher order function

the function which is in parameter is called callback function
