Primitve data types works with value.
var a=20;
var b=a;
a and b will have same values

number, strings, boolean,undefined,null
boolean: boolean is used to store or return values true or false. true also means 1 and false 0;

undefined and null:
undefined: not updated till now
null: value is not there...
null vs undefined.
var a=null;
var a=unefined;

operators: 
a+b==> a,b are operands, + is operator , a+b is operation

There are several operator types:
1. Arithematic Operators:
These operators are used to perform arithematic operations
+,- ,* ,/, %, **
eg: 10/3-->3.33
10%3--->1
2**3 --> 2 power 3 --->8

2. Relational operators:
These operators are used to represent comparison
>, < ,>=, <=, ==, ===, !=, !==

==  vs ===: == is used to compare two values but it will consider the data types. so 20=="20" will be true,
=== also compares data type so 20==="20" will be false

3. Assignment Operators:
 These operators are used to assign some values
 +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,=
 a+=2===> a= a+2
 a-=2 ===> a= a-2;
 these are also called short hand methods

4. unary operators:
unary operator need only one operands
+ is unary operator to convert string to number
++ is an increment operator to increase the value by 1
-- is an decrement operator to decrease the value by 1

pre increment(++a===> incremnet+ update) , post increment (a++===>update+ increment)

a=55;
a++ + --a + ++a + a--;
55 + 55 + 56 + 56

x=20,y=30;
x++ + --y + ++y + --x
20+29+30+20

5. ternary operator or conditional operator:
ternary operator will take three operands
 (condition) ? statemnet : statemnet ;
a=20
 var k = (a>25) ? 5 : 2 ;

 /* eligible to vote or not */
 (age > 18) ? console.log("eligible") :  console.log("not eligible") ;

 6.Logical Operators: 
 These operators are used to apply the conditions logically
 raj is good and raj works well ==> T and T ==> T
 raj is good or raj works well ==>  F and F ==> F
 Today rain will not come 
&&, ||, !
a=5;
(a>3) && (a <5) ==> F
(a<5) || (a>3) ==> T
!(a>5)===> T
