Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)

CSS is used for styling/Designing of the Web Page.
CSS can be implemented in HTML using three ways.
1. inline CSS: in the line of an element , we can write "style" as a property.
2. internal CSS: usually all css with selectors can be included in "Style" element
usually syntax
<style>
  selectors{
    propert:value;
  }
</style>
3. External CSS: you can write css in external file with extension .css and link that file in HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="link" />
Preferences:

!important can bring anything to the top of priority chain

class is used to identify the element or group of elements. multiple elements may have same class name or one element may have multiple class names.
to use class , we use . notation
id is unique for an element
to use id , we use # notation
